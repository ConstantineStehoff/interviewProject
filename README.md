Answer to an interview question for Affirma Consulting

The compiled version of the project is located in dist/release folder (so you can just get this folder and run 
it separately to see if it works although all of the files are minified). src folder contains the original code
and src folder in dist is a copy of it but it gets compiled into the release folder. 

I used grunt, bower, npm, angularjs, jquery, and less for this project.

So, if you want to run the local server or compile the project you have to install node and grunt. The project
contains the package.json and bower.json files so you just need to run 'npm install' and 'bower install' to install
all of the packages.

You can use a command 'grunt server' to run the project locally. Also, in order to compile the project simply
run 'grunt' or 'grunt default'.

Thank you
